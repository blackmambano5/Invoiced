# Invoiced class
For those times when you just need an invoice.

### About
This class is made to make it easier for developers to create quick invoices on the fly.
We are using the API from [https://invoice-generator.com](https://invoice-generator.com "https://invoice-generator.com").

### Rate limited
The API is rate limited, however, it should be sufficient for a reasonable amount of testing and use. If you plan to use this in production at high volumes then let's talk at hello@invoiced.com.
